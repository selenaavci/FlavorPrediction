# Flavor Predictor Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Flavor Predictor Project! This repository contains code for a machine learning project focused on predicting preferred flavors based on age and gender inputs. Leveraging Python's pandas and scikit-learn libraries, I built a decision tree classifier to recommend flavors tailored to individual profiles.

## Dataset

The dataset "flavour.csv" used in this project comprises three columns: Age, Gender, and Flavour. It includes information on age, gender, and the corresponding preferred flavor for a sample of individuals.

## Requirements

To run the code locally, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

-pandas
-scikit-learn

## Results

This decision tree classifier successfully predicts preferred flavors based on age and gender inputs. By analyzing the provided dataset, the model recommends flavors tailored to individual profiles with high accuracy.
